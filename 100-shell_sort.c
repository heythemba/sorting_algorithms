/**
 * shell_sort - program that performs the "Shell sort" algorithm on an array in ascending order
 *
 * Shell sort is an advanced variant of the insertion sort that reduces the
 * movement of elements across long distances;
 * the algorithm works by comparing and swapping elements that are distant from each other,
 * rather than adjacent, effectively reducing the total number of movements;
 * this function initially sorts elements far apart from each other and progressively reduces
 * the gap between the elements to be compared;
 * the final stage of the algorithm is a simple insertion sort, but by this time, most elements
 * are already sorted, making the process faster;
 * the function iterates over the array, gradually reducing the gap and sorting the elements until
 * the entire array is sorted
 *
 * we must use the following sequence of intervals (the "Knuth sequence"):
 * n+1 = n * 3 + 1  -->  1, 4, 13, 40, 121, ...;
 * weâ€™re expected to print the array each time we decrease the interval
 *
 * @array: a pointer to the array that needs to be sorted
 * @array_size: the size of the array
 *
 * Return: nothing (void)
